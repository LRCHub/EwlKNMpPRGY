[00:14.91] All I know
[00:25.77] So unreal
[00:36.63] Watch you go

[00:49.98] I tried so hard and got so far
[00:56.11] But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[01:01.14] I had to fall to lose it all
[01:06.92] But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[01:25.92] 
[01:12.21] I tried so hard and got so far
[01:17.96] But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[02:39.70] But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[02:58.70] 
[02:45.10] I tried so hard and got so far
[02:50.81] But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[02:55.82] I had to fall to lose it all
[03:01.72] But in the end, it doesn't even matter
